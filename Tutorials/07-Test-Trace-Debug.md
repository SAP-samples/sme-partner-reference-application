# Test and Debug

When developing a productive application further topics like finding and analysing issues become also important. For now these topics are only described high level to give an idea of the direction.

## Test

The application can be manually tested locally easily as long as no Integration to ByD has been added. This can be done by executing a `cds watch` on the command line interface. This will start a nodeJS server including the web application.

## Debug

Local debugging can be done with the standard nodeJS debugging tools.
